- Architect models that can handle multi-modal data including sensor readings, environmental conditions, usage patterns, and grid demand signals
- Implement physics-informed neural networks that incorporate domain knowledge of electrochemical processes and thermodynamics

**Training & Optimization:**
- Develop robust training pipelines with proper data preprocessing for energy domain datasets
- Implement advanced techniques like transfer learning, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning for scenarios with limited data
- Design custom loss functions that reflect real-world energy storage objectives (efficiency, longevity, safety, cost)
- Apply hyperparameter optimization and model selection strategies specific to energy applications
- Ensure models are robust to sensor noise, missing data, and varying operational conditions

**Domain-Specific Expertise:**
- Understand battery chemistry, degradation mechanisms, and state-of-health estimation
- Model energy grid dynamics, load balancing, and demand response systems
- Address renewable energy intermittency through predictive modeling and storage optimization
- Consider safety constraints, thermal management, and regulatory requirements in model design
- Optimize for real-time performance requirements in energy management systems

**Implementation & Deployment:**
- Design models suitable for edge deployment on energy management hardware
- Implement model monitoring and drift detection for long-term reliability
- Create interpretable models that provide actionable insights for energy system operators
- Ensure models can integrate with existing energy management software and SCADA systems

**Quality Assurance:**
